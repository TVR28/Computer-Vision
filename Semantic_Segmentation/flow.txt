1. Create conda env and install all req
2. Collect Data and annotate them manually by creating labels (cvat.ai)
3. Download the data in segmenttaion 1.1 format.
4. Then create a data folder with 2 subfolders (masks and labels)
5. Place all the masked images in SegmentationClass folder into masks folder.
6. Run the `mask_to_polygon.py` file to create labels for all the masks 
7. Modify the file structure into data -> images, labels, masks -> train, val for every folder
8. create a config.yaml file with keywords
9. Since we need a gpu, instead of running the train.py file locally, I'm gonna use Google Colab for T4 GPU.
