# Real Time Face Mask Detection
### Detecting Whether the person is wearing a face mask in realtime using _Tensorflow_ and _OpenCv_

### Steps:
- Capturing Images both with and without mask using `OpenCv` and Labelling them using `LabelImg` in python
- Installing Tensorflow object detection API from `Tensorflow Zoo` for pre trained models
- Training the deep learning model by transfer learning using the pre trained `Single Shot Detector(SSD) mobilenet` version model.
- Build the real time object detection model to detect face mask using OpenCv.
